## About

The main task of the application is collection as much as possible information about Pokemon in one place.
In the current version, users can: 
* view a list of Pokemon (in three various variants: gallery, list or details cards)
* look for specific Pokemon
* add Pokemon to favourite list
* read a lot of pieces of information, such as evolution chain, damage relations, and abilities

## In the near future

My goals to achieve in the near future:
* add advanced filtering feature while browsing the Pokemon collection
* add the Pokemon comparison feature
* significantly develop landing page

## Long-time assignments

* implement a simple stats based card game

## Technology stack
* React.js
* React context api
* React testing library
* React router dom
* Bootstrap
* axios

## All powered by [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/)
